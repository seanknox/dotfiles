## Description

All tooling in this repo is meant to be run on a MacOS or Linux machine. They involve real commands that
when executed can cause irrepairably damage the system. 

## When to Use

- Be careful! These commands run on a computer. ASK for permission every time when running a command. Never assume it is ok. 
- The commands change the system configuration: dotfiles, nix, system files. They require a human operator to verify and execute.
